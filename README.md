# JS-Project

Phase 2 project assessment!

JS Milestone project - Comment section
Today we will create a comment section using JavaScript and HTML. Many companies
like Swiggy, Uber, Flipkart, Ola, Cred, etc. use the machine coding rounds as their
primary filters to eliminate candidates. And any machine coding round wouldn’t allow
you to use dependencies or libraries such as React, Lodash, jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.
Hence, you should solve some problems using JavaScript and HTML to improve your
speed, gain comfort around these lines and finally, ace this particular round.
As I always say, divide your problem into subsets, then address each subset one by
one.
SUBSETS —

1. The page is always launched with two static textarea at the top and an add
   button that allows the user to add comments.
2. One textarea for username and second textarea is for comment section
3. Every comment added will have a like, a dislike and a delete button.
4. A like button will keep incrementing the number of likes on the respective
   comment at every click.
5. A dislike button will keep decrementing the number of dislikes on the respective
   comment at every click.
6. A delete button will delete the comment.
7. Comments once added should be persisted on page reload — this is an
   enhancement, it can be attended to in the end if you have time.
   Before you jump into the code, step back for a few minutes, look at your requirements
   and assess which parts could use the same piece of code.
